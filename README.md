# Kiwi-Ninja-game
2D Platformer coded in under 24 hours for HackWestTx 2023.

## About the game:
I programmed this game using the Unity game engine which I had no experience coding in before the hackathon. Within 24 hours I learned how to create and build a 2d platforming game with multiple levels. The objective of the game is to dodge obstacles while collecting the kiwis hidden around the map. Once you collect the kiwis you can reach the finish flag to go to the next level.

## Known Bugs:

**The QUIT button on the finish screen DOES NOT WORK so you will have to manually kill the program. (Use Alt + F4 to kill the program)**

You can stick to the side of the moving platforms.
Kiwi counter in top left corner is currently not updating correctly.

## Future of Kiwi Ninja:
I plan on fixing the current bugs and reworking the UI so that it works as intended. I will add a button to the finish screen to return to the main menu and restart the game. The skills and knowledge I learn from this game will be used to build my own game completely from scratch. I plan to start working on that later this year.
